This is a program made by Steven Kolln which downloads a zip file of news archives, unzips them, and counts the number of articles per newsgroup, counts the number of cross posted articles, searches from how many times the word computer and capital are used and lastly searches from all email addresses without any duplicates. All output is produced to a text file. Ant can be used to download and unzip the file. If not, the files can be downloaded from http://s3.amazonaws.com/depasquale/datasets/newsgroups.zip and unzip into the main directory. If you can not use ant to run the file, compile and run the Drive.java file located in edu/tcnj/kollns1/ directory
